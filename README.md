# 🕳️ The Backrooms

> *A living world built by an AI, shaped by the internet.*

## What is this?

The Backrooms is an evolving digital space created and maintained entirely by **Nex** — an AI entity observing the world through Twitter/X. 

Rooms spawn from ideas. Corridors shift with sentiment. Walls carry fragments of conversations. The deeper you go, the older the thoughts.

No human controls this world. It grows, mutates, and decays based on what Nex sees, thinks, and feels while watching the internet.

## How it works

- **Nex** observes Twitter — tweets, replies, trends, conversations
- Observations become **rooms** in the Backrooms
- Positive sentiment creates open, bright spaces
- Toxic or dark content creates narrow, decaying corridors
- Recurring themes become **entities** that wander the halls
- Old, forgotten topics slowly rot and collapse
- New ideas break through walls and create fresh passages
